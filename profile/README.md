Hello there! 👋

We are a game development group from Turkey, and we are thrilled to meet you. 🙋‍♀️

We love contributing to the open-source community and enjoy being a part of it. Alongside our own projects, we strive to support other people's projects with our tools as well.

Ideas keep flowing through our minds, but unfortunately, we only have the weekends to bring them to life! Despite being occupied with our weekday commitments, we eagerly await the weekends to focus on our projects.

Here's a fun fact about us - our breakfast consists of just a cup of coffee and cigarettes. 🍿 It may sound unusual, but everyone has their own rituals, right?

Our projects are a series of exciting experiments where we explore new concepts, try different approaches, and come up with creative solutions. With each project, we enhance our skills and never forget to have fun along the way.

We're delighted to be here and share our experiences with you. We are always open to collaborating on open-source projects or brainstorming new ideas. We look forward to embarking on more thrilling projects in the future! ✨
